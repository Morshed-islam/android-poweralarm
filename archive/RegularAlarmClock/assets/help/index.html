        <h2 id="usage">1 Usage</h2>

        <p>For quick setup follow these steps:
            <ol>
                <li>Open Power Alarm</li>
                <li>Tap "Alarm" tab at bottom right corner to open Alarm view.</li>
                <li>Tap "Add" button at top right corner to create new alarm.</li>
                <li>Input alarm name, select which time alarm should go off.</li>
                <li>If you want a cyclical repeating alarm, tap "+" button in
                    "Repeat Rule", then tap "Everyday" to select other
                    rules.</li>
                <li>Tap "Save" at top right corner.</li>
                <li>Tap "Schedule" at bottom left corner to see when alarms will go off.</li>
                <li>You can also check when the next alarm will go off in notification bar.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>Following instructions will help you understand how Power Alarm
        works as well as advanced features you may want to know.</p>

        <p>In Power Alarm there are two important concepts; Alarm and Schedule.
        Alarm is the rule you create to generate Schedule, while Schedule is
        the actual time an alarm will go off. For example, if you create one Alarm to
        go off at 8:00 everyday, you will in Schedule see entries at
        8:00 today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and so on.</p>

        <p>When you open Power Alarm the Schedule view is presented, where you can
        see when all alarms will go off for the following two weeks. You can also disable
        the next alarm only, without affecting the others in the series. Check
        <a href="#schedule">Schedule</a> for a brief introduction.</p>

        <p>If you want to modify alarm rules, tap Alarm tab. The Alarm view
        is presented, where you can create/modify/delete alarm rules, as well as
        disable/enable alarm rules. Check <a href="#alarm">Alarm</a> for a
        brief introduction.</p>

        <p>After you modify alarm rules, the Schedule view will be updated
        accordingly. Always go to Schedule view to make sure that the time at which the alarm should go off
        is correct after you make modifications to an alarm rule.</p>

        <p>After alarm is set, the next alarm time will be shown in
        notification bar, as well as remaining time. Tapping the notification
        bar message will open Power Alarm. You can disable
        notification bar message in <a href="#preferences">Preferences</a>.</p>

        <p>When an alarm goes off, you will find Dismiss and Snooze button in
        Alarm view. The Snooze button is very large by default, however you
        can choose to use a regular size Snooze button in
        <a href="#preferences">Preferences</a>. The Dismiss and Snooze buttons
        will be disabled for 2 seconds when alarm goes off, as well as after
        the device is taken out of a pocket, to prevent misoperation.</p>

        <p>If you tap "Dismiss" button, the alarm is dismissed and the next alarm
        time will be set (if one exists).</p>

        <p>If you tap "Snooze", the alarm will snooze and go off again 10
        minutes later. Snooze time is configurable in
        <a href="#preferences">Preferences</a>. After alarm snooze, you will
        find a message in notification bar. Tap the message to dismiss the
        snoozed alarm, a dialog will popup to confirm.</p>

        <p>If you neither dismiss nor snooze the alarm, it will be snoozed
        automatically after sometime. After 2 times of automatic snooze,
        the alarm will be dismissed. A message will be left in notification
        bar. Auto snooze times is configurable in
        <a href="#preferences">Preferences</a>.</p>

        <a href="#title">Back to Top</a>


        <h2 id="schedule">2 Schedule</h2>

        <p>When Power Alarm is launched, the Schedule view is presented.
        You can go back to Schedule view by tapping "Schedule" tab when you are in
        Alarm view.</p>

        <p>In Schedule view you will find a list of all alarms set to go off
        the following two weeks. The alarm times are ordered by the time they
        will go off. In addition, the very first entry shows the next alarm time as
        well as remaining time.</p>

        <p>To disable/enable a schedule, just tap the button on the right.
        The disabled schedule will turn gray and will not go off. This feature is beneficial
        if you for example have created an alarm rule to go off
        at 7:00 everyday. Then it's possible to disable the alarm only for tomorrow
        morning, the alarms for the day after tomorrow and following days will still go off as planned.</p>

        <p>After you modify alarm rules, the Schedule view will be updated
        accordingly. Always check Schedule view to make sure that the alarm time
        is correct after you have modified an alarm rule.</p>

        <a href="#title">Back to Top</a>

        <h2 id="alarm">3 Alarm</h2>

        <p>Open Alarm view by tapping "Alarm" tab when you are in Schedule view.
        </p>

        <p>Alarm view is where you can create, view, modify or delete alarm
        rules. All alarm rules are listed in Alarm view. Tap an alarm rule to
        edit it, press and hold to open context menu, where you can
        view/delete/clone it.</p>

        <p>To create a new alarm rule, tap "Add" button at the top right
        corner.</p>

        <p>To create a new alarm rule similar to an existing one, press and hold
        an existing alarm rule and then tap "Clone" from context menu.</p>

        <h3 id="alarm-create">3.1 Create/Edit Alarm</h3>

        <dl>
            <dt>Name</dt>
            <dd>Tap the text box to input alarm name. The alarm name will
            be shown when the alarm goes off. It can also be spoken out loud by Power Alarm
            if you <a href="#preferences">enable "Say Alarm Name" feature in
            Preference view</a>.</dd>

            <dt>Time</dt>
            <dd>Scroll to change alarm time.</dd>

            <dt>Repeat Rule</dt>
            <dd>Initially the repeat rule is "One Time", which means the rule
            is empty, and the alarm will only go off one time.<br/>
            Tap "+" button to add a repeat rule, the edit rule menu is opened. Tap the list to select
            what kind of rule you want to govern your alarm, and edit the corresponding options to your liking,
            then press "OK". Under "Repeat Rule" you can at any time get back to the edit rule menu by tapping the name of the rule.
            Available rule types are:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Selected Dates</strong>: selected arbitrary
                        dates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Everyday</strong>: will go off everyday.</li>
                    <li><strong>Day of Week</strong>: select from Monday to
                        Sunday, will go off every week.</li>
                    <li><strong>Day of Week in Month</strong>: select from
                        Monday to Sunday, will only go off on selected numerical week(s) (first, second, third etc) of every
                        month.</li>
                    <li><strong>Day of Last Week in Month</strong>: select
                        from Monday to Sunday, will only go off in selected one week (last, second to last, etc) of
                        every month.</li>
                    <li><strong>Day of Month</strong>: selected days of every
                        month.</li>
                    <li><strong>Day Month Range</strong>: selected day and month range.</li>
                    <li><strong>Day Month Year Range</strong>: selected day, month, and year
                        range.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alarm X Off Y Days</strong>: select a
                        start date, an X and an Y. Alarm will go off on the start
                        start date, continue going off for X days, then pause for
                        Y days, then go off for X days again in a cycle.</li>
                </ul>
            Tap "trash" button to delete repeat rule.<br/>
            If more then one repeat rule exists, beginning with the second rule there
            will be a combining rule, tap "Plus" to select from:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Within</strong>: go off only on dates existing
                    both in previous rules and this rule. e.g. [day1, day2,
                    day3] Within [day1, day3, day4] will result in [day1,
                    day3].</li>
                    <li><strong>Plus</strong>: go off on all dates existing in
                    previous rules and this rule. e.g. [day1, day2] Plus
                    [day2, day3] will result in [day1, day2, day3].</li>
                    <li><strong>Subtract</strong>: go off on dates existing in
                    previous rules but not in this rule. e.g. [day1, day2,
                    day3] Subtract [day3, day4] will result in [day1, day2].
                    </li>
                </ul>
            Hence it's possible to combine more repeat rules to achieve more
            complex results.<br/>
            Press and hold on a repeat rule and drag to move its order in rule
            list.
